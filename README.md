# LDL-Learning-Deep-Learning

My learning journey for researching Deep Learning using PyTorch. This repository includes work into investigating and experimenting with tensors, neural-networks and deep learning.

### **`<Note to self>`Pulling and Pushing Changes:**

To make changes to code and update my progress. I need to:

1. Make sure I'm on the `main` branch.
   `git checkout main`
2. Pull remote changes. Sometimes `--allow-unrelated-histories` is needed
   `git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories`
3. Resolve conflicts (if any) from the pull.
4. Add files / changes and commit with commit message.
   `git add .` or `git add <filepath or name> `
   `git commit -m "commit name"`
5. Push changes to the repo.
   `git push origin main
   `
